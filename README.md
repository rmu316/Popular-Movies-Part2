# Popular-Movies-Part2

#About
Part 2 to the popular movies app for my Android program. Changes include:
- Better UX
- More details (e.g. youtube trailers, reviews)
- ability to share movie details on other apps
- ability to save favorite movies locally

#Usage
The main screen is still the screen with all the movie thumbnails. Clicking on a thumbnail will bring you to a more detailed page
of a movie, filled with links to youtube trailers, as well as links to reviews. In addition, on the details page, a user can save a movie as one of their favorites by clicking on the button that says so. Clicking on the share icon on the details page allows the user to share basic movie details on a variety of apps on the phone. In addition, clicking on the settings icon on the main page allows a user to see movies based on highest rated, most popular, as well as their own favorite list.
